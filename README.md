# Polish Keyboard Layout Optimizer


## Assumptions and goal
Let's dive straight in: our mission is to craft the ultimate keyboard layout for typing in Polish. How do we define "ultimate"? Simple. It's all about minimizing the distance your fingers need to travel while typing. Less travel, more speed, better efficiency.

### What does the best mean?
In the realm of keyboard layouts, "best" is all about efficiency. It's a game of finding a layout where your fingers barely have to move to hit the right keys. Think of it as choreographing a finger balletâ€”smooth, swift, and efficient.

### Our Target User
Our muse is the classic 10-finger typist, using the traditional home row keys. We're designing for the typist who's all about A, S, D, F, and J, K, L, ; - but with a Polish twist. This means embracing all the unique characters of the Polish language.

### A Note on Variability
Here's where it gets spicy: different datasets lead to different layouts. From formal documents to casual tweets, the variety in language use means our optimal layout might shift a bit. And remember, keyboards themselves are diverse creatures. The spacing and placement of keys can vary, so our ideal layout might not be universally perfect.


## Methodology
It's all about the data. We're diving deep into the CC100-Polish dataset to explore common words and typing patterns, including those unique Polish characters. Feel adventurous? Mix in other datasets for a broader view. Our goal? A keyboard layout that feels like it's reading your mind, with the least amount of finger travel possible.
